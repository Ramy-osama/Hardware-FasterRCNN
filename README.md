# Hardware-FasterRCNN
This is the implementation for a hardware Faster-RCNN neural network architecture used in object detection in autonomous cars we will divide this project into 2 parts
The first part is the software implementation of our Faster-RCNN neural network
The second part of the code is the hardware implementation of the backbone network of the Faster-RCNN (VGG-16) to fasten the simulation 
The hardware implementation will be only used in inference mode and we will use the software implementation to get the correct weights we will 
use in the hardware part

##Software implementation

We will be simulating the Faster-RCNN architecture using google colabs as this will fasten the training using google servers
